## Step 1: Navigate to TikTok
Navigate to https://tiktok.com/ and create an account or log in.
## Step 2: Start watching a Minecraft stream
Search "minecraft" in the upper search bar, and click on the `LIVE` tab. Then, choose a streamer.
## Step 3: Activate TikTok systems
In order to set off the flag, send the word "Minecraft" in the chat, and a notification should appear saying you are able to get a cape!
## Step 4: Claim the cape
Once you get a notification saying you can claim the cape, click on the notification, you should get a code. Open a new tab and type https://minecraft.net/redeem, then paste in the code and click `Redeem`. Then, follow on-screen instructions.

Notes:
* This is a very new development, so keep an eye out for updates.
* ~~This is potentially region-locked, we're not sure if this is 100% true yet.~~ Apparently only Aussies can't get it. Why? I don't know.
* This cape is available in Bedrock Edition immediately, and in Java Edition on July 8th.
