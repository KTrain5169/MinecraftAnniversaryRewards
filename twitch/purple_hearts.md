# How to get the Purple Hearts cape

This guide is focused on obtaining the Twitch Purple Hearts cape.

## Step 1: Join a Minecraft Twitch stream
Go to https://twitch.tv/ and log in (if you have an account already) or sign up (if you don't). Then, go to `Browse` and click on the `Minecraft` category. Click on a streamer, and **check to see if there is a checkmark next to their name**. This is important because Twitch directly states that you must watch a partnered or Affiliate channel streaming Minecraft to get the reward.
## Step 2: Start the timer
Once you've chosen your streamer, click on the Follow button and start chatting! (Please make sure to respect the streamer's rules!) This will start the timer for the 15 minutes you need to watch to get the cape.
