# How to get the Purple Hearts cape

This guide is focused on obtaining the Twitch Purple Hearts cape.

## Step 1: Join a Minecraft Twitch stream
Go to https://twitch.tv/ and log in (if you have an account already) or sign up (if you don't). Then, go to `Browse` and click on the `Minecraft` category. Click on a streamer, and **check to see if there is a checkmark next to their name**. This is important because Twitch directly states that you must watch a partnered or Affiliate channel streaming Minecraft to get the reward.
## Step 2: Start the timer
Once you've chosen your streamer, click on the Follow button and start chatting! (Please make sure to respect the streamer's rules!) This will start the timer for the 15 minutes you need to watch to get the cape. Periodically chat as well so that Twitch can see that you are still watching.
Tips:
* You can leave the tab in the background and the volume set to 1%.
* Try and actually engage with the stream if you want this process to be fun. Ask around, reply to messages, whatnot.
* Some channels have a bot that marks your watch time (like StreamElements). You can do the bot's watch time command to check, however be aware that this isn't always helpful especially if you've watched the streamer before. Also, the watchtime count rounds down in 10m intevals, so if you see 0m watchtime, you're between 0m-9m59s watchtime, seeing 10m watchtime means you're between 10m-19m59s watchtime, and so on.
* Following isn't necessary, but it does (for some reason) update Twitch faster that you are, in fact, watching the stream. Chatting also has this effect, but it's even more quirky somehow. Don't ask me.
## Step 3: Claim your cape
Once you get the notification saying the cape is available, click on it, or if you missed it click on the `Inventory` button. From there, you'll be directed to claim the cape, after which a code appears.

Go to https://minecraft.net/redeem, then input the code into the box **WITHOUT THE DOT**. Then, click on "Redeem" and then confirm that you are logged into the account you want to claim it on.

## Notes
* Twitch isn't handling this very well. If you don't get the notification for even a couple hours, that appears to be normal as of right now. Gotta be patient. (If you're on mobile, refreshing apparently helps).
* You can do this with multiple Twitch accounts for your Minecraft alts, if you have any.
* This cape will be available immediately for Bedrock players and on June 8th for Java players.
