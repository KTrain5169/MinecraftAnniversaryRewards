# Obtaining the Twitch Glitch Mask reward

This guide is focused on obtaining the Twitch Glitch Mask reward.

## Step 1: Join a Minecraft Twitch stream
Go to https://twitch.tv/ and log in (if you have an account already) or sign up (if you don't). Then, go to `Browse` and click on the `Minecraft` category. Click on a streamer, and **check to see if there is a checkmark next to their name**. This is important because Twitch directly states that you must watch a partnered or Affiliate channel streaming Minecraft to get the reward.
## Step 2: Subscribe/gift subs for the streamer
Once you've chosen your streamer, click the `Subscribe` or `Gift a Sub` button. Proceed through to checkout, and, if you've chosen to gift, choose a person to gift to.
## Step 3: Claim your Mask
After completing this, click on the `Notification` box (you may need to refresh to see it). Open your Inventory and then open a new tab and type https://minecraft.net/redeem. Then, copy the code you got from Twitch and paste it into the Redeem page. Follow the prompts to obtain the cape.

## Notes
* You can do this with multiple Twitch accounts for your Minecraft alts, if you have any. (Just be prepared to spend a bit)
* This mask is exclsive to Bedrock Edition (as far as I know). Sorry Java players.
